# Radius Roadmap

Welcome to the Radius Roadmap repository! This repo is used for tracking important items in the Radius roadmap and is managed by the Radius maintainers.

To view the roadmap, head over to the [**Roadmap Project**](https://github.com/orgs/radius-project/projects/8).

## Roadmap process

The Radius roadmap is updated monthly based on ongoing progress in the project, as well as from feedback from [Discord](https://aka.ms/radius/discord), GitHub Issues, and [community calls](https://github.com/radius-project/community). Please let us know how we can improve Radius and we'll take that feedback directly back into roadmap planning!

### Stages

The Radius roadmap is broken down into 5 stages:

- 💡 **Proposed** - Work items or ideas that have been proposed or are under consideration
- 📋 **Accepted** - Work items that have been accepted into the Radius Roadmap
- ✏️ **Designing** - Work items that are currently being researched and designed
- 🛠️ **Developing** - Work items that are actively in development
- ✅ **Done** - Work items that are complete and shipped as part of Radius
